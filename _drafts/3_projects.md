### Research Interests:
**Digital Humanities**: Scholarly Digital Editions; eXtensible Markup Language and related technologies (XSLT, XPath, XQuery); Text Encoding Initiative; Web technologies; Electronic Textual Analysis; Data mining and Analysis of Linguistics Corpora; Stylistic Analysis and Authorship Studies

**Medieval & Renaissance Studies**: Mediterranean Cultures and Languages; Translation Studies; Medieval and Early Modern Translations in the Iberian Peninsula (1200-1600); Textual Scholarship and Philology; Biography as genre; Medieval Latin and Romance Lexicography; Classical Tradition and Reception in Romance Literature PROJECTS

### Research lines: 

**1. History of Translation in Medieval and Early Modern Europe**
One of my main interests focuses on history of translation, and particularly on translations between Italian and Latin, and Spanish and Catalan, broadly from 1300 to 1500 C.E. I conceive translation as one of the main sources to reconstruct cultural and literary networks, in my case, between the Iberian Peninsula and Italy in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. My main method is based on close readings, an analysis of linguistic variations, and a breakdown of the cultural and literary understandings of the translated texts. I have extensively studied the figure of Alfonso de Palencia, a Spaniard translator active at the end of the fifteenth century. 
I worked with three digital projects that combined translation studies and digital edition. The first one was the [Boscán Project](), a catalogue of Spanish translations of Italian literary works; the second one was the hypertext of [Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, translated by Jerónimo de Urrea]() in the sixteenth century. The third one was the *Zibaldone Europeo*, where I was in charge of designing the web prototype with the original Italian text, along with the corresponding Spanish and English translations.
 
**2. Digital Scholarly Edition**
My interest in traditional philology and textual criticism has its counterpart, in digital terms, in my attention to digital scholarly editions and in all technologies implemented in the process. I study the nature of the digital change from print to digital, and I dig into textual markup systems, such as the Text Encoding Initiative, Markdown, Pandoc, Latex and other formats. I also work with other technologies intended for the manipulation and transformation of files, such as the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT). I explore as well the conception of search engines and the construction of databases (eXist, BaseX). This same line of research leads me to web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Web Design Frameworks (Jekyll, Foundation, BootStrap) to build web pages and interfaces created for new editorial projects.

**3. History of Lexicography, Digital Lexicography, Corpus Linguistics, and Electronic Text Analysis**
In recent years I worked with several Europeans Medieval Latin dictionaries, and I currently delve into lexicography from different perspectives. First, I am very interested in the history of lexicography and the creation of the first European Medieval and Early Modern dictionaries and glossaries. Second, I pay close attention to the different standard markup systems in use and I explore the possibilities of lemmatization of ancient corpora, interoperability and database creation. Furthermore, my interest for dictionaries leads me to intersect with the process of creation and use of textual corpora, especially in historical and linguistic research. I enjoy studying, teaching and pursuing the different phases of the corpus retrieval process: how to assemble, prepare, encode, analyze, and interpret digitized textual data, both in theory and in practice by means of simple and more refined statistical tools, such as TXM, R, RStudio, or Gephi.

Related to this topic, I organized two key events attended by international scholars: the “Workshop for Ancient and Medieval Lexicographical Works” in Barcelona, Spain, where we discussed the challenges and the encoding standards for these type of works; and the training school “Creation and Use of Medieval Textual Corpora” in Minorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. Both events were funded by the European Association for Digital Humanities (EADH).

From now on, I plan to work with the Universal Vocabulario en latín y en romance de Alfonso de Palencia, which will aloud me to conduct research in the fields of historical digital lexicography and digital edition. 

**4. Classical Reception in European Literature; History and Reception of the Biographical Genre; Intertextuality and Text Reuse**
Another of my research fields is the reception of Classical and Italian literature in the Iberian Peninsula. During my PhD research, I explored Classical and Italian reception in the Iberian Peninsula mostly through translations during the fourteenth up to the sixteenth centuries. Consequently, I have widely studied the European reception of Plutarch and his Parallels Lives, exploring the biography conceived as a literary genre, from ancient Greece, through the Middle Ages, until the recovery of classical models by Italian Humanists and the European Renaissance. In digital terms, I am deeply fascinated for intertextuality and text reuse. Therefore, I plan to study this reception from another point of view and through digital methods in order to reconstruct networks of interconnections between authors and cultures. The idea of tracking textual repetition and borrowing under the form of verbatim quotes, allusions, or paraphrases by means of algorithmic methods opens new ways to reconstruct cultural and literary backgrounds of single authors.
In 2015 I published my first book, titled **Las Vitae Hannibalis et Scipionis de Donato Acciaiuoli, traducidas por Alfonso de Palencia**, released by Brepols in 2014. I provided a study of the biographical and literary traditions of the two military leaders, Hannibal and Scipio. I enhanced the Latin text by collating the manuscripts witnesses and enriching the critical apparatus, as well as the Spanish translation with multiple comments and notes regarding the translation method.
