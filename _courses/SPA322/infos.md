Description of the course: 
This course faces multiple issues related to digital culture, and the different ways that technology and the Internet shape social interaction, thinking and communication. It puts special emphasis on the Digital in the Humanities, or on what has been called the Digital Humanities. Cultural institutions and industries, libraries, academia, among many other sectors, have already faced a digital transformation that updates the outcomes of the cultural and humanistic artifacts. During the semester, students will gain both theoretical knowledge on multiple issues, like how the internet works or how a digital identity is built, and practical experience, for example, building an e-portfolio, while coding and creating their own webpage. We will study in which ways the production of (literary) texts has changed, while analyzing new ways of publication and learning different encoding languages. Concepts such as close reading vs distant reading will give us the opportunity to use different electronic analytical tools. An inside visit to the Richter Library will allow students to understand how libraries handle digital collections and the role of metadata within their catalogs and repositories. 
This course is taught in Spanish and will use, preferably, Latin American and Iberian literary texts. Students will be required to do weekly exercises, three small digital assignments, which will lead (preferably, but not necessarily) to a final digital personal project. Even though the course has technical components, no previous computer programming or design experience is required.
